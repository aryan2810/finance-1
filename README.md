# Trade Practice

This is a US stock trading simulator which helps you to check your trading strategy in real-time using dummy currency.
You can get a lot of insight into how the world of finance and stock markets functions. 
I have used an API IEXCLOUD to fetch live data about the stock prices in real time alongwith other information.

-You can buy, sell and check your portfolio.
